# CNN-visualizations

The code for this repo is private.

**Problem Statement**: Sometimes it becomes difficult to visualize how deep learning models are interacting and transforming the input in visual systems. So in order to understand that we have different visualization techniques that can be used to model this transformation.

**Techniques**:
1. Saliency Maps
2. Backpropagation
3. Guided Backpropagation
4. Grad-Cam
5. Guided Grad-Cam
6. Content loss
7. Focal Loss
8. Style Transfer
